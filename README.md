# MIM
Prototyping the "Meet in the Middle" application, which aims to take user input of one or more user locations, and based on the activity they are planning suggests suitable locations to meet for the said activity.

Dependancies:
1. Python modules needed are listed in the "requirements.txt file"
2. Google Maps API usage:(At the time of writing this,13-03-2023) 
        You would need to create a google cloud account.
        Create a project using the Google Maps Billing.
        Enable the API associated with Google Maps.(I enabled all for now).
        To use the generated API Key in this project, Save the Key to the "google_map_api_key.txt".
        You would have to create this txt file as I added this to my gitignore to make sure not expose my API KEY.
